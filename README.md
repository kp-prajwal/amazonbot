# Python Bot which tracks Amazon prices

This is a simple, beginner yet an intuitive project which basically tracks the price of a product and lets you know via mail.
## Aim : Bot sends you an E-mail once the cost of the product decreases to the desired value.

Modules Used : BeautifulSoup, Requests and smtplib(mail)
It asks for your to email, your password and secondary email/to email. It is safe for the user to enter their personal details. 
However, if you do not trust me with entering your personal details, you could use 2-step authentication by Google to create a temporary password.
Note : This, however, works only if the program is executed. If you want the bot to be live, you could add it to a server or add it to the Start directory of your computer i.e executes automatically everytime you start/restart your computer.


PS : CHANGE IN CODE : Replace '<' instead of '>'.
      ~ I have inserted '<' as prices did not seem to decrease from the Amazon side.
      ~ '<' was for testing purpose only.
